			<label class="box-title" for="q3">Why are there different interest rates on the CareCredit credit card application?</label>
			<label class="box-close" for="acc-close"></label>
			<div class="box-content">The APR is 32.99% for new accounts (as of 5/30/24). Existing cardholders should see their credit card agreement for applicable terms. The Minimum Interest Charge is $2.
Our No interest if Paid in Full Within 6, 12, 18 and 24 month promotional financing options (sometimes called Deferred Interest) let you pay for qualifying purchases of $200 or more with monthly payments. Interest accrues during the promotional period from the purchase date but will not be charged if you pay your promotional balance in full by the end of the promotional period. Minimum monthly payments required.**
Our Reduced APR special financing options of 24, 36, 48, and 60 months are for larger purchase amounts, letting you make required fixed monthly payments until paid in full with a reduced interest rate. Purchases of $1,000 or more may be eligible for a 24 months offer with a 17.90% APR, a 36 months offer with a 18.90% APR or a 48 months offer with a 19.90% APR. Purchases of $2,500 or more may be eligible for a 60 months offer with a 20.90% APR.*** 
With No Interest if Paid in Full promotional financing options, no interest will be charged on your promotional balance if you pay your balance in full by the end of the promotional period. If you do not, interest will be charged to your account from the purchase date. Promotional financing is only available at providers in the CareCredit Network and select retailers, but not everywhere else Mastercard is accepted. For those purchases, standard account terms apply.
For complete details on your CareCredit account, consult your Credit Card Account Agreement.  
<p>
** No interest will be charged on the promo purchase if you pay it off, in full, within the promo period. If you do not, interest will be charged on the promo purchase from the purchase date. The required minimum monthly payments may or may not pay off the promo balance before the end of the promo period, depending on purchase amount, promo length and payment allocation. Regular account terms apply to non-promo purchases and, after promo period ends, to the promo balance. Subject to credit approval.
</p>
<p>
*** Interest will be charged on promo purchases from the purchase date. Fixed monthly payments are required until paid in full and will be calculated as follows: on 24-month promotions – 4.9876% of initial promo purchase amount; on 36-month promotions – 3.6605% of initial promo purchase amount; on 48-month promotions – 3.0377% of initial promo purchase amount or on 60-month promotion - 2.6997% of initial promo purchase amount. The fixed monthly payment will be rounded up to the next highest whole dollar and may be higher than the minimum payment that would be required if the purchase was a non-promo purchase. During the last month(s) of the promo period the required monthly payment may be reduced due to the prior months’ rounding. Subject to credit approval.

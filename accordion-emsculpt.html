<h2>Emsculpt Description</h2>
<div>
<h5>What is Emsculpt?</h5>
<p>Emsculpt is a type of noninvasive body sculpting that uses the only FDA cleared device to build muscle and burn fat. With HIFEM technology, our Emsculpt device induces 20,000 supramaximal muscle contractions that are accompanied by a rapid metabolic reaction in fat cells. These muscle contractions release free fatty acids which results in burning fat cells and defining ab muscles.</p>
<h5>What Are the Benefits of Emsculpt?</h5>
<p>It is impossible to achieve abdominal contractions at the same rate as Emsculpt through exercise, even for those in the best shape. As a result, Emsculpt is an ideal body sculpting option for individuals who have hit a plateau in their workout routine. Another significant benefit is that you build muscle during your session! Unlike other body sculpting procedures such as liposuction, which do not work with your body's natural processes to produce results, Emsculpt uses your abdominal muscles to create a toned, sculpted appearance. By stimulating your abdominal muscles with HIFM energy to provide an intense workout, muscle grows, resulting in sculpted abs and less abdominal fat. It's like having a very strenuous workout but with better results!</p>
<p>There are other reasons clients choose Emsculpt including:</p>
<ul>

<li>Minimal pain</li>
<li>1 session equals 20,000 crunches</li>

</ul>
